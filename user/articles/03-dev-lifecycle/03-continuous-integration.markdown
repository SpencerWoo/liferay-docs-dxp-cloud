# Continuous Integration

DXP Cloud contains Jenkins Continuous Integration by default. When you send a
pull request or make a commit to one of your pre-configured GitHub branches, it
triggers an automatic test cycle to check your code for any errors. If the tests
pass, DXP Cloud builds your services and shows their status on your
environment's Builds page. If the tests fail, you can check the Jenkins
dashboard and logs at `ci-companyname-infra.lfr.cloud`. 

| Note: Continuous integration only works if you are deploying from GitHub, not
| from the CLI.
