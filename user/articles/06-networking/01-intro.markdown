# Networking

Your DXP Cloud services can communicate securely with external services and
other services in the same environment. Here, you'll learn how to configure and
use these features:

**Load Balancer:** Handle all public connections with our advanced load 
balancer. 

**Private Networks:** Communicate between services in an environment via that
environment's private network. 

**Custom Domains:** Easily configure your custom domains without our intuitive
domain router. 

**VPN Connection:** Connect your DXP Cloud services to external services that 
have their own private network.
