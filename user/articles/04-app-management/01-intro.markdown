# Application Management

DXP Cloud gives you all the tools you need to manage applications in your
environment. Here, you'll learn about these features:

**Shell Access:** Access the shell via the web console and terminal.

**Environment Variables:** Control how services behave in an environment.

**Log Management:** Access logs via the web console and terminal.

**Custom Domains:** Add a custom domain to your DXP Cloud service.

**Backup and Restore:** Backup and restore data in your environment.

**Health Checks and Zero-downtime Deployments:** Use health checks to validate
deployment success and provide accurate self-healing. By default, services have
100% availability during redeployment (zero-downtime). 

**Auto Scaling:** Automatically upscale/downscale your service to optimize
performance.
